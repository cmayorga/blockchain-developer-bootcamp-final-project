# Consensys Blockchain Developer BootCamp Final Project

Create a Yield protocol and Farm site, pay rewards in a ERC20 token and reduce rewards each week

Created CONS ERC20 token and added liquidity to pair CONS/WETH (Wrapped ETH) at Uniswap

So the customer can stake his Liquidity Provider (LP) Token in our farm to receive CARLOS tokens as rewards

Rewards are distributed as 69000 each week between all stakers, reducing 5% each week until 0

A daemon script in Python will execute the add of new rewards each week to the contract
